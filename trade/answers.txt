Task 3
1)The client sends an request, that he wants to see a specific site to 
  the server(for example: get /owner/Jim).
  The Server then processes this request by looking at the verb and the following url.
  Depending on these paramaters the server executes different actions like:
  creating a HTML file or redirect the client.

2)Get usually doesn't alter the original data. This is used to prevent the 
  clients from altering important data on the server. If not it could result in 
  unpredictable results or a client could even exploit something.

3)In the Views. These are the acctual representation of what the client will see.
